## How Vibe Works

Each day, answer engines are asked commercially significant questions, such as:

- "Is [Brand] SOC 2 compliant?"
- "What are the best running shoes for kids with flat feet?"
- "Which vendors lead in healthcare analytics?"

Their responses are not simply a reordering of websites. They are synthesized narratives, combining fragments from multiple sources into direct, opinionated advice. Whether your brand is accurately recalled, favorably framed, or mentioned at all increasingly depends on how these systems retrieve, evaluate, and reason about available content.

Vibe helps companies surface how they are currently understood inside answer engines — and offers tools to manage and improve those perceptions over time.

Vibe is structured around three continuous pillars: **Monitor**, **Evaluate**, and **Optimize**.

- **Monitor** tracks when and how AI Agents engage with your brand online — providing a proxy for brand interest inside AI-driven conversations.
- **Evaluate** measures how your brand is remembered, preferred, and cited by AI systems — using focus group-style testing across critical brand dimensions.
- **Optimize** deploys targeted interventions to improve brand recall, competitive preference, and industry influence — based on what evaluation reveals.

Each pillar feeds into the next, creating a continuous feedback loop that adapts as AI systems — and the customer journeys they shape — evolve over time.
