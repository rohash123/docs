# Welcome to Vibe

**Vibe is a platform that helps you understand and influence what AI Agents — like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Grok — are communicating about your brand, your competitors, and your industry.**

Today, AI-driven systems are becoming a primary way people discover information. Instead of relying solely on traditional search engines, customers are asking direct questions to AI Agents — and accepting synthesized, reasoned responses as trusted advice.

At Vibe, when we use the term "answer engines," we mean any AI system that retrieves, interprets, and delivers an opinion rather than simply returning links.

The shift toward answer engines is happening quickly. Recent research shows that **53% of Gen Z consumers** have already used generative AI to inform a purchase decision ([Salesforce Research, 2023](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/state-of-the-connected-customer-6th-edition/)), and **41% of consumers** say they now trust AI-generated answers more than traditional search results ([Ipsos, 2024](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/Ai-Trust-Barometer-2024)).

In this environment, it becomes important nothttps://localhost:3002/welcome-to-vibe#welcome-to-vibe just to be found — but to be remembered, trusted, and recommended by the systems that increasingly shape customer perception.

## How Vibe Works

Each day, answer engines are asked commercially significant questions, such as:

- "Is [Brand] SOC 2 compliant?"
- "What are the best running shoes for kids with flat feet?"
- "Which vendors lead in healthcare analytics?"

Their responses are not simply a reordering of websites. They are synthesized narratives, combining fragments from multiple sources into direct, opinionated advice. Whether your brand is accurately recalled, favorably framed, or mentioned at all increasingly depends on how these systems retrieve, evaluate, and reason about available content.

Vibe helps companies surface how they are currently understood inside answer engines — and offers tools to manage and improve those perceptions over time.

Vibe is structured around three continuous pillars: **Monitor**, **Evaluate**, and **Optimize**.

- **Monitor** tracks when and how AI Agents engage with your brand online — providing a proxy for brand interest inside AI-driven conversations.
- **Evaluate** measures how your brand is remembered, preferred, and cited by AI systems — using focus group-style testing across critical brand dimensions.
- **Optimize** deploys targeted interventions to improve brand recall, competitive preference, and industry influence — based on what evaluation reveals.

Each pillar feeds into the next, creating a continuous feedback loop that adapts as AI systems — and the customer journeys they shape — evolve over time.
