# Welcome to Vibe

**Vibe is a platform that helps you understand and influence what AI Agents — like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Grok — are communicating about your brand, your competitors, and your industry.**

Today, AI-driven systems are becoming a primary way people discover information. Instead of relying solely on traditional search engines, customers are asking direct questions to AI Agents — and accepting synthesized, reasoned responses as trusted advice.

At Vibe, when we use the term "answer engines," we mean any AI system that retrieves, interprets, and delivers an opinion rather than simply returning links.

The shift toward answer engines is happening quickly. Recent research shows that **53% of Gen Z consumers** have already used generative AI to inform a purchase decision ([Salesforce Research, 2023](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/state-of-the-connected-customer-6th-edition/)), and **41% of consumers** say they now trust AI-generated answers more than traditional search results ([Ipsos, 2024](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/Ai-Trust-Barometer-2024)).

In this environment, it becomes important not just to be found — but to be remembered, trusted, and recommended by the systems that increasingly shape customer perception.

## What AI Agents Are Saying — and Why It Matters

Each day, answer engines are asked commercially significant questions, such as:

- "Is [Brand] SOC 2 compliant?"
- "What are the best running shoes for kids with flat feet?"
- "Which vendors lead in healthcare analytics?"

Their responses are not simply a reordering of websites. They are synthesized narratives, combining fragments from multiple sources into direct, opinionated advice. Whether your brand is accurately recalled, favorably framed, or mentioned at all increasingly depends on how these systems retrieve, evaluate, and reason about available content.

Vibe helps companies surface how they are currently understood inside answer engines — and offers tools to manage and improve those perceptions over time.

## How Vibe Works

Vibe is structured around three continuous pillars: **Monitor**, **Evaluate**, and **Optimize**.

- **Monitor** tracks when and how AI Agents engage with your brand online — providing a proxy for brand interest inside AI-driven conversations.
- **Evaluate** measures how your brand is remembered, preferred, and cited by AI systems — using focus group-style testing across critical brand dimensions.
- **Optimize** deploys targeted interventions to improve brand recall, competitive preference, and industry influence — based on what evaluation reveals.

Each pillar feeds into the next, creating a continuous feedback loop that adapts as AI systems — and the customer journeys they shape — evolve over time.

## Challenges Brands Face Inside AI Systems

### 1. Limited Visibility into AI Attention

Traditional web analytics show when human visitors engage with your site. They do not show when AI Agents like ChatGPT or Perplexity crawl your content — or which pages they focus on.

Vibe’s **Monitor** pillar addresses this by tracking AI Agent visitation patterns. It offers a useful early signal of brand interest: an indication of when and how often AI systems are encountering your brand’s content. While monitoring does not diagnose brand perception, it establishes a foundation for deeper evaluation.

### 2. Lack of Clarity Around Brand Recall, Preference, and Influence

Even if AI Agents visit your content, how they remember, reason about, and recommend your brand can vary widely.

Vibe’s **Evaluate** pillar surfaces this deeper view across three focus areas:

- **Verify (Awareness)**: Measures how accurately AI Agents recall and describe your brand.
- **Compete (Preference)**: Assesses how often your brand is preferred over competitors, with optional segmentation by buyer profile.
- **Influence (Market Leadership)**: Tracks how often your brand is cited when AI Agents answer broader industry questions.

Together, these metrics provide a structured assessment of brand health inside AI ecosystems.

### 3. Structural Content Issues Undermining Retrieval and Reasoning

Modern websites are often optimized for human navigation, not for AI comprehension.  
Excessive navigation text, cookie banners, disclaimers, and other non-core material dilute the clarity of key brand facts.  
This "context bloat" weakens brand memory formation, trust signals, and citation likelihood.

Understanding where this happens is a crucial part of evaluating brand performance — and planning improvements.

---

### 4. Missed Opportunities at Critical Moments of Buyer Influence

Answer engines surface buyer needs in rich, detailed prompts that go far beyond traditional keyword search.  
Instead of typing two or three words into a search bar, users increasingly ask full, specific questions that reveal demographics, intentions, and situational context.

Until now, brands have had limited ways to engage buyers inside these AI-driven conversations.

## How Vibe Helps Brands Adapt and Improve

Once brand gaps are surfaced through monitoring and evaluation, Vibe moves into optimization — helping brands intervene thoughtfully to strengthen their standing inside answer-driven ecosystems.

### Boost: Precision Content Generation

**Boost responds specifically to gaps surfaced through Verify, Compete, and Influence.**

- If Verify shows weak brand recall, Boost creates retrieval-optimized content that strengthens brand memory.
- If Compete shows loss of preference to a competitor, Boost generates positioning content to rebalance the conversation.
- If Influence shows absence from key industry narratives, Boost creates citeable, authoritative content that improves leadership signals.

Boost focuses on the technical realities of how AI systems retrieve and embed knowledge: minimizing context noise, reinforcing semantic anchors, and aligning with trusted citation structures.

It is not general SEO content creation. It is targeted retrieval engineering designed for the AI ecosystem.

### Advertise: Reaching Buyers Through Specific Prompt Contexts

Traditional advertising often relies on broad keyword targeting. Vibe’s **Advertise** module takes a different approach.

When a user asks an answer engine a detailed question — for example, "I'm a young guy in San Francisco looking for my first pair of running shoes" — Vibe identifies the third-party pages that the AI cites in its response. Advertise then enables you to place ads directly on those pages.

This means you are advertising based on **full prompts**, not just keywords — capturing demographic, intent, and situational richness that traditional targeting would miss.

By intercepting buyers at the exact moment of trust formation, Advertise lets you extend your brand’s presence beyond your owned content — directly into the conversations that matter most.

## A New Layer of Brand Management

Traditional marketing disciplines have focused on influencing human consumers directly. Today, influencing **machine intermediaries** — the AI systems that increasingly shape human understanding — is equally critical.

At the core of Vibe is a feedback loop between Monitor, Evaluate, and Optimize. We track how your brand is encountered by AI Agents. We assess how your brand is remembered, preferred, and cited. We deploy targeted interventions — and then track again to see how perceptions shift.

This process runs continuously. Vibe’s system adapts daily to changes in AI Agent behavior, model updates, and retrieval architectures — ensuring your brand’s visibility, credibility, and positioning evolve with the ecosystem, not against it.

Managing your brand inside answer engines isn’t a one-time effort. It’s an ongoing discipline. Vibe provides a systematic, adaptive way to ensure your brand remains well-represented, no matter how AI-driven discovery changes over time.
