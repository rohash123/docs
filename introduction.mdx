# Welcome to Vibe

**Vibe is a platform that helps you understand and influence what AI Agents — like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Grok — are communicating about your brand, your competitors, and your industry.**

Today, AI-driven systems are becoming a primary way people discover information. Instead of relying solely on traditional search engines, customers are asking direct questions to AI Agents — and accepting synthesized, reasoned responses as trusted advice.

At Vibe, when we use the term "answer engines," we mean any AI system that retrieves, interprets, and delivers an opinion rather than simply returning links.

The shift toward answer engines is happening quickly. Recent research shows that **53% of Gen Z consumers** have already used generative AI to inform a purchase decision ([Salesforce Research, 2023](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/state-of-the-connected-customer-6th-edition/)), and **41% of consumers** say they now trust AI-generated answers more than traditional search results ([Ipsos, 2024](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/Ai-Trust-Barometer-2024)).

In this environment, it becomes important not just to be found — but to be remembered, trusted, and recommended by the systems that increasingly shape customer perception.
