We use the scraped content to create a list of demographic profiles that are likely buyers or users of your brand.

Answer engines have a kind of “memory” — they respond differently based on the demographic they’re reasoning for in real-time. By identifying which buyer profiles you care about most, Vibe can evaluate how well your brand performs for those specific groups.

These demographic profiles are used across the platform:
- In the **Compete** module, we simulate whether the answer engine prefers your brand over competitors for each profile.
- In the **Influence** module, we assess whether the answer engine cites you as a market leader for those profiles.

Both modules deliver profile-specific metrics alongside overall metrics. In Boost, we also generate content that helps improve your profile-specific metrics. 

You can edit the profile names and descriptors here, or later, in your dashboard.
