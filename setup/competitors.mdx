Next, we generate a list of competitors based on the scraped content from your website. We leverage the answer engine to generate these competitors, revealing which companies it internally considers competitors to your brand. These competitors are used to study evaluate your ranking and the modelâ€™s preference as part of the Compete module. 

You can also add a new competitor by just providing the name of the company, and delete any competitors we suggest from your list of tracked competitors. You can edit competitors and their descriptions here, or later on in your dashboard.
